## Software

I'll use Anaconda running on Linux

### Anaconda

Download the Anaconda installer from the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), download the files in the Anaconda folder from this repo and edit them so that they reference to eachother.

Move anaconda.desktop to ~/.local/share/applications
